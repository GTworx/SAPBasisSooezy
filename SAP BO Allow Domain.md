Restricting email delivery in SAP BusinessObjects (BO) to a specific domain involves configuring the system to permit emails only to addresses within that domain. Unlike SAP NetWeaver ABAP systems, which utilize transaction SCOT for email configurations, SAP BO requires different approaches. Here are some methods to achieve this restriction:

1. **Implement Restrictions at the SMTP Server Level:**
   - Configure your organization's SMTP server to allow outgoing emails solely to the desired domain. By setting up rules or policies on the SMTP server, you can ensure that emails sent from SAP BO are restricted to addresses within the specified domain. This approach centralizes email management and enforces domain restrictions effectively. citeturn0search2

2. **Modify SAP BO Application Code:**
   - Customize the SAP BO application by adding code to validate the recipient's email domain. This involves editing the relevant JavaServer Pages (JSP) files to include checks that permit emails only to addresses within the allowed domain. While this method provides control within the application, it requires careful implementation to ensure maintainability and compatibility with future updates. citeturn0search6

3. **Utilize Third-Party Tools or Middleware:**
   - Employ third-party tools or middleware solutions that act as intermediaries between SAP BO and the SMTP server. These tools can be configured to filter outgoing emails, ensuring they are sent only to the specified domain. This approach offers flexibility and may simplify the implementation process without altering the core SAP BO application.

**Considerations:**

- **System Updates and Maintenance:** When modifying application code or using third-party tools, ensure that these changes are compatible with future system updates to prevent potential issues.

- **Security and Compliance:** Implementing domain restrictions aligns with organizational security policies, preventing unauthorized data dissemination and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations.

By adopting one or a combination of these approaches, you can effectively configure SAP BusinessObjects to send emails exclusively to a specific domain, thereby enhancing control over email communications and adhering to organizational policies. 

The screenshot shows the configuration for the **Adaptive Job Server** email destination in **SAP BusinessObjects (BO)**. To restrict emails to only one domain (e.g., `example.com`) and prevent sending emails to other domains, consider the following approaches:

### **1. Restrict via SMTP Server**
- The SMTP server (`smtp.example.com`) can be configured to allow email delivery only to addresses within `@example.com` and reject other domains.
- This is the most secure and effective way to enforce domain restrictions.

### **2. Use SAP BO Security Settings**
- In **SAP BO Central Management Console (CMC)**:
  - Navigate to **Servers** > **Adaptive Job Server** > **Destination**.
  - Set a restriction in the **"To" field** so that only emails ending in `@example.com` are allowed.

### **3. Modify the Job Destination Rules**
- If SAP BO jobs dynamically generate email addresses, ensure that:
  - The placeholder `%SI_EMAIL_ADDRESS%` is validated against a whitelist.
  - Only emails ending in `@example.com` are allowed.

### **4. Custom Script or Middleware**
- If your setup allows scripting, implement a **custom email validation script** that filters out non-`@example.com` addresses before the email is sent.
